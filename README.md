Assignment Questions

#1 How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting customer needs is about getting closer to the customer requirements and needs, and thus passing that information along to
a development team in a clear and concise manner so that teams can turn them into features that provide value to the customer.
User Stories are helpful in this regard because they further define the requirements in a simple to digest but structure format,
the stories are also suppose to have a sense of their own "personality" allowing one to view a requirement from a users perspetive, 
such perspective gives a developer helps them to understand why and how this is important and how it provides value to the customer.

#2 How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

My apporach is typically in the form of iterative development where one's focus is on breaking down large complex tasks into smaller more managable 
chunks allowing for more effcient sprints, Agile is very explicit on encouraging collaboration, communication and adaptability to change, these are very important 
for a team to be effective and self organzing. I would plan oin utilizng Daily Scrums, Sprint Retrospectives, and Sprint planning into a futire work of mine,
these practices help to mantain a proper and consistant flow of information and help to keep the team at large informed on the progress of the devlopment, 
it also allows for teams to share both their ideas and concerns and reflect on how anything can be changed or improved upon to make the devlopment better.

#3 What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team memeber is about mostly taking initiative and contributing to the success of a team effort, because Agile doesnt utilize the traditional
format of having people above you constantly overseeing your work its important to practice good commuincation, offering support to team memebers where needed,
participating in the various Agile events like the Daily Scrum or Retrospective to help contribute to updating the team on progress sharing ideas. Being a good
team memebers is also about collabroating, listening to other memebers and their ideas and concerns, providing constructive feedback, this is not limited to self,
this is a responsibility of all memebers of a devlopment team, doing this means the differnece between and sucessful product or a unsucessful one.
